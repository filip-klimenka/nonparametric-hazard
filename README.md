# Nonparametric hazard rate
## Kernel estimation of hazard function with an application to market microstructure.

We use the nonparametric hazard model by Wolter (2015) to estimate the probability of trade arrival as a function of depth.
The hazard rate is estimated using kernel approach and the optimal kernel bandwidth is selected using the method proposed by Gamiz et al. (2013).

See hazard_report.pdf for a brief summary of the analysis and results.
